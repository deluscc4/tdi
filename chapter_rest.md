# Técnicas de Invasão

## Chapter 8, 10, 11 and 12: Exploring

### Exploit: script or instruction to attack something
Exploit Database: https://www.exploit-db.com/

**CVE** stands for **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures** and it is a glossary that classifies vulnerabilities. <br>
The glossary analyzes vulnerabilities and then uses the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** to evaluate the threat level of a vulnerability. <br>

### Metasploit is a software inside the Kali Linux with payloads, exploits and tools ready for usage.

Exploiting is: executing the threat against the vulnerability.

``cd /usr/share/webshells/`` => Shells into Kali Linux ready for usage

### Fuzzing is an automated software testing method that injects invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs into a system to reveal software defects and vulnerabilities.
Eg.: Uploading a file ``.php`` does not work. If you change it to ``.phtml`` or ``.php5`` it works.
